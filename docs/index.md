This paper presents opinionated design notes on memory, context management, orchestration, 
and self-directed evolution in AI and AGI systems. In this context, AI and AGI are primarily
discussed with current LLM-based systems in mind.

As interest in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) continues to grow, it becomes increasingly
important to examine not only model scaling or training methods, but also how systems manage
memory over long time horizons, revise their own internal structures, and coordinate complex
internal processes.

Rather than proposing a finalized architecture or implementation, this work explores a set of
aggressive design hypotheses, including memory maps, selective context retrieval, controlled
and extensible orchestration, modular skill representations, multi-model utilization, and
self-directed internal updates.
